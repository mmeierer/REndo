\description{
Fits linear models with one endogenous regressor and no additional explanatory variables using the latent instrumental variable approach
presented in Ebbes, P., Wedel, M.,  Böckenholt, U., and Steerneman, A. G. M. (2005). This is a statistical technique to address the endogeneity problem where no external instrumental
variables are needed. The important assumption of the model is that the latent variables are discrete with at least two groups with different means and
the structural error is normally distributed.

\details{
Let's consider the model:
\deqn{Y_{t} = \beta_{0} + \alpha P_{t} + \epsilon_{t}}{Y_t = b0 + a * P_t + eps_t}
\deqn{P_{t}=\pi^{'}Z_{t} + \nu_{t}}{P_t = pi * Z_t + nu_t}
where \code{t = 1,..,T} indexes either time or cross-sectional units, \eqn{Y_{t}}{Y_t} is the dependent variable, \eqn{P_{t}}{P_t} is a \code{k x 1} continuous, endogenous regressor,
\eqn{\epsilon_{t}} is a structural error term with mean zero and \eqn{E(\epsilon^{2})=\sigma^{2}_{\epsilon}}{E(eps^2) = sigma_eps^2}, \eqn{\alpha}{a} and \eqn{\beta}{b0}
are model parameters. \eqn{Z_{t}}{Z_t} is a \code{l x 1} vector of instruments, and \eqn{\nu_{t}}{nu} is a random error with mean zero and \eqn{E(\nu^{2}) = \sigma^{2}_{\nu}}{E(nu^2) = sigma_nu^2}.
The endogeneity problem arises from the correlation of \code{P} and \eqn{\epsilon_{t}}{eps} through \eqn{E(\epsilon\nu) = \sigma_{\epsilon\nu}}{E(eps * nu) = sigma_0^2}.

\code{latentIV}  considers \eqn{Z_{t}^{'}}{Z_t} to be a latent, discrete, exogenous variable with an unknown number of groups \code{m} and \eqn{\pi}{pi} is a vector of group means.
It is assumed that \code{Z} is independent of the error terms \eqn{\epsilon}{eps} and \eqn{\nu}{nu} and that it has at least two groups with different means.
The structural and random errors are considered normally distributed with mean zero and variance-covariance matrix \eqn{\Sigma}{Sigma}:
\deqn{\Sigma = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2} \& \sigma_{\epsilon\nu}\\
\sigma_{\epsilon\nu} \& \sigma_{\nu}^{2}
\end{array}\right)}{Sigma = (sigma_eps^2,       sigma_0^2 ; sigma_0^2,       sigma_nu^2)}
The identification of the model lies in the assumption of the non-normality of \eqn{P_{t}}{P}, the discreteness of the unobserved instruments and the existence of
at least two groups with different means.

The method has been implemented such that the latent variable has two groups. Ebbes et al.(2005) show in a Monte Carlo experiement that
even if the true number of the categories of the instrument is larger than two, \code{latentIV} estimates are approximately consistent. Besides, overfitting in terms
of the number of groups/categories reduces the degrees of freedom and leads to efficiency loss. When provided by the user, the initial parameter values
for the two group means have to be different, otherwise the model is not identified. For a model with additonal explanatory variables a Bayesian approach is needed, since
in a frequentist approach identification issues appear. The optimization algorithm used is Nelder-Mead.

Additional parameters used during model fitting and printed in \code{summary} are:
