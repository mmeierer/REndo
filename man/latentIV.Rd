\description{
Fits linear models with one endogenous regressor and no additional explanatory variables using the latent instrumental variable approach
presented in Ebbes, P., Wedel, M.,  Böckenholt, U., and Steerneman, A. G. M. (2005). This is a statistical technique to address the endogeneity problem where no external instrumental
variables are needed. The important assumption of the model is that the latent variables are discrete with at least two groups with different means and
the structural error is normally distributed.

\details{
Let's consider the model:
\ifelse{html}{\out{<br><center>Y<sub>t</sub>=&beta;<sub>0</sub>+&alpha;P<sub>t</sub>+&epsilon;<sub>t</sub></center>}}{ \deqn{Y_{t} = \beta_{0} + \alpha P_{t} + \epsilon_{t}}}
\ifelse{html}{\out{<center>P<sub>t</sub>=&pi;'Z<sub>t</sub>+&nu;<sub>t</sub></center>}}{ \deqn{P_{t}=\pi^{'}Z_{t} + \nu_{t}}}

where \eqn{t = 1,..,T} indexes either time or cross-sectional units, \ifelse{html}{\out{Y<sub>t</sub>}}{\eqn{Y_{t}}} is the dependent variable,
\ifelse{html}{\out{P<sub>t</sub>}}{\eqn{P_{t}}} is a \code{k x 1} continuous, endogenous regressor,
\ifelse{html}{\out{&epsilon;<sub>t</sub>}}{\eqn{\epsilon_{t}}} is a structural error term with mean zero
and \ifelse{html}{\out{E(&epsilon;<sup>2</sup>)=&sigma;<sub>&epsilon;</sub><sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{E(\epsilon^{2})=\sigma^{2}_{\epsilon}}},
\eqn{\alpha} and \ifelse{html}{\out{&beta;<sub>0</sub>}}{\eqn{\beta_0}} are model parameters.
\ifelse{html}{\out{Z;<sub>t</sub>}}{\eqn{Z_{t}}} is a \code{l x 1} vector of instruments,
and \ifelse{html}{\out{&nu;<sub>t</sub>}}{\eqn{\nu_{t}}} is a random error with mean zero and
\ifelse{html}{\out{E(&nu;<sup>2</sup>)=&sigma;<sub>&nu;</sub><sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{E(\nu^{2}) = \sigma^{2}_{\nu}}}.
The endogeneity problem arises from the correlation of \eqn{P} and \ifelse{html}{\out{&epsilon;<sub>t</sub>}}{\eqn{\epsilon_{t}}}
through \ifelse{html}{\out{E(&epsilon;&nu;)=&sigma;<sub>&epsilon;&nu;</sub>}}{\eqn{E(\epsilon\nu) = \sigma_{\epsilon\nu}}}

\code{latentIV} considers \ifelse{html}{\out{Z<sub>t</sub>'}}{\eqn{Z_{t}^{'}}} to be a latent, discrete, exogenous variable with an unknown number of groups \eqn{m} and \eqn{\pi} is a vector of group means.
It is assumed that \eqn{Z} is independent of the error terms \eqn{\epsilon} and \eqn{\nu} and that it has at least two groups with different means.
The structural and random errors are considered normally distributed with mean zero and variance-covariance matrix \eqn{\Sigma}:
\ifelse{html}{\out{<center>&Sigma;=(&sigma;<sub>&epsilon;</sub><sup>2</sup>, &sigma;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sigma;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>, &sigma;<sub>&nu;</sub><sup>2</sup>)</center>}}{
\deqn{\Sigma = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2} \& \sigma_{\epsilon\nu}\\
\sigma_{\epsilon\nu} \& \sigma_{\nu}^{2}
\end{array}\right)}}

The identification of the model lies in the assumption of the non-normality of
\ifelse{html}{\out{P<sub>t</sub>}}{\eqn{P_{t}}}, the discreteness of the unobserved instruments and the existence of
at least two groups with different means.

The method has been implemented such that the latent variable has two groups. Ebbes et al.(2005) show in a Monte Carlo experiment that
even if the true number of the categories of the instrument is larger than two, estimates are approximately consistent. Besides, overfitting in terms
of the number of groups/categories reduces the degrees of freedom and leads to efficiency loss. For a model with additional explanatory variables a Bayesian approach is needed, since
in a frequentist approach identification issues appear.

Identification of the parameters relies on the distributional assumptions of the latent instruments as well as that of
the endogenous regressor \ifelse{html}{\out{P<sub>t</sub>}}{\eqn{P_{t}}}.
Specifically, the endogenous regressor should have a non-normal distribution while the unobserved instruments, \eqn{Z}, should be discrete and have at least two groups with different means Ebbes, Wedel, and Böckenholt (2009).
A continuous distribution for the instruments leads to an unidentified model, while a normal distribution of the endogenous regressor gives rise to inefficient estimates.

Additional parameters used during model fitting and printed in \code{summary} are:
\describe{
\item{pi1}{The instrumental variables \eqn{Z} are assumed to be divided into two groups. \code{pi1} represents the estimated group mean of the first group.}
\item{pi2}{The estimated group mean of the second group of the instrumental variables \eqn{Z}.}
\item{theta5}{The probability of being in the first group of the instruments.}
\item{theta6}{The variance, \ifelse{html}{\out{&sigma;<sub>&epsilon;</sub><sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}}}}
\item{theta7}{The covariance, \ifelse{html}{\out{&sigma;<sub>&epsilon;&nu;</sub>}}{\eqn{\sigma_{\epsilon\nu}}}}
\item{theta8}{The variance, \ifelse{html}{\out{&sigma;<sub>&nu;</sub><sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{\sigma_{\nu}^{2}}}}
}
