\title{Fitting Linear Models with Endogeneous Regressors using Gaussian Copula - Method 2}
\usage{
copulaMethod2(y, X, P, intercept = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a vector or matrix containing the dependent variable.}

\item{X}{a data frame or matrix containing the regressors of the model, both exogeneous and endogeneous. The last column/s should contain the endogeneous variable/s.}

\item{P}{a matrix containing the endogeneous variables. They should be continuous and non-normally distributed.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "lm".
}
\description{
It fits linear models with several endogeneous regressors using Gaussian Copula proposed by Park and Gupta (2012).
