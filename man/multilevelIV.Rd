\title{Multilevel GMM Estimation}
\usage{
multilevelIV(formula, data, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A symbolic description of the model to be fitted. See the "Details" section for the exact notation.}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the data of all parts specified in the formula parameter.}

\item{verbose}{Show details about the running of the function.}
}
\description{
** THIS METHOD IS NOT AVAILABLE, YET!

Estimates multilevel models (max. 3 levels) employing the GMM approach presented in Kim and Frees (2007).
One of the important features is that, using the hierarchical structure of the data, no external instrumental
variables are needed, unlike traditional instrumental variable techniques
}
\details{
Method will be added to the package in the next major release.
