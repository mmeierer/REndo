\title{Simulated Dataset with One Endogenous Continuous Regressor}
\format{
A data frame with 2500 observations on 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{y}}{a numeric vector representing the dependent variable.}
\item{\code{X1}}{a numeric vector, normally distributed and exogenous.}
\item{\code{X2}}{a numeric vector, normally distributed and exogenous.}
\item{\code{P}}{a numeric vector, continuous and endogenous having T-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom.}
}
}
\usage{
data("dataCopCont")
}
\description{
A dataset with two exogenous regressors,
 \code{X1},\code{X2}, and one endogenous, continuous regressor,
 \code{P}, having a T-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom.
 An intercept and a dependent variable, \code{y}, are also included.
 The true parameter values for the coefficients are: \code{b0 = 2}, \code{b1 = 1.5},
 \code{b2 = -3} and the coefficient of the endogenous regressor, P, is equal to \code{a1 = -1}.
