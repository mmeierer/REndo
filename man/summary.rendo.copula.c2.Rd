\title{Confidence Interval for copula correction models fitted with augmented OLS.}
\usage{
\method{summary}{rendo.copula.c2}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted model object.}

\item{...}{ignored, for consistency with the generic function.}

\item{num.simulations}{the number of times the model is re-fitted to obtain confidence intervals in case of discrete endogenous regressors only. Ignored with a warning otherwise.}
}
\description{
In the case of only discrete endogenous regressors, the model is re-fitted multiple times
and the confidence interval is obtained for each fitted model. The mean of all simulated confidence
intervals per parameter is reported.

In all other cases, the standard method for a fitted linear model \code{\link[stats]{lm}} is applied.
