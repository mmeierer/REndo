\usage{
copulaEndo(y, X, P, param = NULL, type = NULL, method = NULL,
  intercept = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{the vector or matrix containing the dependent variable.}

\item{X}{the data frame or matrix containing the regressors of the model, both exogeneous and endogeneous. The last column/s should contain the endogenous variable/s.}

\item{P}{the endogenous variables of the model as columns of a matrix, or as a vector if it is just one variable.}

\item{param}{The vector of initial values for the parameters of the model to be supplied to the optimization algorithm. The parameters to be estimated are \code{theta = \{b,a,rho,sigma\}}, where
\code{b} are the parameters of the exogenous variables and \code{a} is the parameter of the endogenous variable.}

\item{type}{the type of the endogenous regressor/s. It can take two values, "continuous" or "discrete".}

\item{method}{the method used for estimating the model. It can take two values, "1" or "2", where "1" is the maximum likelihood approach described in Park and Gupta (2012),
while "2" is the equivalent OLS approach described in the same paper.}

\item{intercept}{optional parameter. The model is estimated by default with
intercept. If no intercept is desired or the regressors matrix \code{X} contains already
a column of ones, intercept should be given the value "no".}
}
\value{
Depending on the method and the type of the variables, it returns the optimal values of the parameters and their standard errors in the case of the second method.
With one endogenous variable, if the maximum likelihood approach is chosen, the standard errors can be computed by bootsptrapping using the \code{\link{boots}} function from the same package.
}
\description{
Fits linear models with continuous or discrete endogeneous regressors using Gaussian copulas, method presented in Park and Gupta (2012).
This is a statistical technique to address the endogeneity problem, where no external instrumental variables are needed. The important assumption of the model is
that the endogeneous variables should NOT be normally distributed.
}
\details{
The maximum likelihood estimation is performed by the "BFGS" algorithm. When there are two endogenous regressors, there is no need for initial parameters since the method applied is by default the augmented OLS, which
can be specified by using method two - "method="2"".

\examples{
#load dataset dataCopC1, where P is endogenous, continuous and not normally distributed
data(dataCopC1)
y <- dataCopC1[,1]
X <- dataCopC1[,2:5]
P <- dataCopC1[,5]
c1 <- copulaEndo(y, X, P, type = "continuous", method = "1", intercept="no")
c1
# to obtain the standard errors use the boots() function
# se.c1 <- boots(10, y, X, P, param = c(1,1,-2,-0.5,0.2,1), intercept= "no)

# an alternative model can be obtained using "method ="2"".
c12 <- copulaEndo(y, X, P, type = "continuous", method = "2")
c1

# load datset with 2 continuous, non-normally distributed endogeneous regressors.
# with 2 endogeneous regressors, there is no need for initial parameters, since the method applied is by default the augmented OLS.
#data(dataCopC2)
#y <- dataCopC2[,1]
#X <- dataCopC2[,2:6]
#P <- dataCopC2[,5:6]
#c2 <- copulaEndo(y, X, P, type = "continuous")
#summary(c2)

# load dataset with 1 discrete endogeneous variable.
# having more than 1 discrete endogenous regressor is also possible
data(dataCopDis)
y <- dataCopDis[,1]
X <- dataCopDis[,2:5]
P <- dataCopDis[,5]
c3 <- copulaEndo(y, X, P, type = "discrete")
c3
