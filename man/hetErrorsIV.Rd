\title{Fitting Linear Models with Endogenous Regressors using Heteroskedastic Covariance Restictions}
\usage{
hetErrorsIV(formula, data, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A symbolic description of the model to be fitted. See the "Details" section for the exact notation.}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the data of all parts specified in the formula parameter.}

\item{verbose}{Show details about the running of the function.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of classes \code{rendo.ivreg} and \code{ivreg}, It extends the object returned from
function \code{ivreg} of package \code{AER} and slightly modifies it by adapting the \code{call}
and \code{formula} components. The \code{summary} function prints additional diagnostic information as
described in \code{summary.ivreg}'s documentation.

All generic accessor functions for \code{ivreg} such as \code{anova}, \code{hatalues}, or \code{vcov} are available.
}
\description{
This function estimates the model parameters and associated standard errors for a
linear regression model with one or more endogenous regressors. Identification is achieved
through heteroscedastic covariance restrictions within the triangular system as proposed in Lewbel(2012).

\details{
?? ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE MATH MODEL ??

The \code{formula} argument has the following notation:
A two-sided formula object describing the MODEL (??), a single endogenous regressor, and
the internal instrumental variables to be built, each part separated by a single vertical bar (\code{|}).
The MODEL (??) part consists of the response on the left of the \code{~} operator and the term labels
on the right-hand side. The sole endogenous regressor is specified in the second right-hand side part
of the formula by separating it with a vertical bar from the MODEL(??). The instrumental variables
that should be built are specified as (multiple) functions, one for each instrument, and
separated from the endogenous regressor by a vertical bar. The function to build the
internal variables is \code{IIV} and uses the following arguments:

\describe{
\item{\code{...}}{The exogenous regressors to build the internal instruments from.
If more than one is given, separate instruments are built for each.}
}

Note that no argument to \code{IIV} is to be supplied as character but as symbols without quotation marks.

Optionally, additional external instrumental variables to be used during the instrumental variable
regression and already present in the data can be specified, again separated by a vertical bar,
as the fourth right-hand side part.

See the example section for illustrations on how to specify the \code{formula} parameter.

# P is the endogenous regressor in all examples

# 2 IVs, one from X1, one from X2
