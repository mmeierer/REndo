\title{Summarizing Bootstrapped copulaCorrection Model Fits for Single Continuous Endogenous variables}
\usage{
\method{summary}{rendo.copula.c1}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{rendo.copula.c1}, a result of a call to \code{copulaCorrection}.}

\item{...}{ignored, for consistency with the generic function.}
}
\value{
The function \code{summary.rendo.copula.c1} computes and returns a list of summary statistics
which contains the following components:
\item{coefficients}{a \code{px4} matrix with columns for the estimated coefficients for the the original data, the standard error of the bootstrapped parameters, and the lower and upper boundaries of the 95\% bootstrap confidence interval.}
\item{num.boots}{the number of bootstraps performed.}
\item{names.main.coefs}{a vector specifying which coefficients are from the model. For internal usage.}
\item{start.params}{a named vector with the initial set of parameters used to optimize the log-likelihood function.}
\item{vcov}{variance covariance matrix derived from the bootstrapped parameters.}
\item{AIC}{Akaike's An Information Criterion for the model fitted on the provided data.}
\item{BIC}{Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion for the model fitted on the provided data.}
\item{KKT1}{first Kuhn, Karush, Tucker optimality condition as returned by optimx.}
\item{KKT2}{second Kuhn, Karush, Tucker optimality condition as returned by optimx.}
\item{conv.code}{the convergence code as returned by optimx.}
\item{log.likelihood}{the value of the log-likelihood function at the found solution for the provided data.}
}
\description{
\code{summary} method for a model of class \code{rendo.copula.c1} resulting from fitting \code{copulaCorrection}
with only a single continuous endogenous variable.
}
\details{
Because the model was fitted using maximum likelihood optimization,
related goodness of fit measures and convergence indicators are also reported.
}
\seealso{
The model fitting function \code{\link[REndo:copulaCorrection]{copulaCorrection}}

\code{\link[REndo:confint.rendo.boots]{confint}} for how the confidence intervals are derived

\code{\link[REndo:vcov.rendo.boots]{vcov}} for how the variance-covariance matrix is derived

\code{\link[optimx:optimx]{optimx}} for explanations about the returned \code{conv.code} and \code{KKT}.

Function \code{coef} will extract the \code{coefficients} matrix and
function \code{vcov} will extract the component \code{vcov} from the returned summary object.
