\value{
For the case of a single continuous endogenous regressor, an object of class \code{rendo.optim.LL} is returned.
It is a list and contains the following components:
\item{formula}{The formula given to specify the model to be fitted.}
\item{start.params}{A named vector with the initial set of parameters used to optimize the log-likelihood function.}
\item{estim.params}{A named vector of all coefficients used during model fitting.}

following components:
\item{original.data}{The original data used to fit the model.}
\item{names.vars.continuous}{The names of the continuous endogenous regressors.}

\description{
Fits linear models with continuous or discrete endogeneous regressors (or a mixture of both) using Gaussian copulas, as presented in Park and Gupta (2012).
This is a statistical technique to address the endogeneity problem where no external instrumental variables are needed.
The important assumption of the model is that the endogeneous variables should NOT be normally distributed, if continuous, preferably with a skewed distribution.
}
\details{
\subsection{Method}{

For the case of a single continuous endogenous regressor maximum likelihood estimation is used.
Therefore, the call of the function is: \\
\code{copulaCorrection(y ~ X1 + X2 + P | continuous(P), data, start.params, num.boots)}, \\

the starting values for \eqn{\rho} and \eqn{\sigma}, where \eqn{\rho} is the correlation between the endogenous regressor and the error, and \eqn{\sigma} is
the variance of the model's error.

In the case of one discrete endogenous regressor, the call of the function is:\\
\code{copulaCorrection(y ~ X1 + X2 + P | discrete(P), data)}\\
Here, an alternative model specification is used, still based on Gaussian copula, but using augmented OLS.
A note in this case: Since the marginal distribution function of the endogenous regressor is a step function in this case,
it is important to also have a look at the confidence interval of the coefficient estimates, by calling the \code{confint()} function.

In the case of multiple endogenous regressors of both discrete or continuous distributions, the call of the \code{copulaCorrection()} function is: \\
\code{copulaCorrection(y ~ X1 + X2 + P1 + P2 | discrete(P1) + continuous(P2), data)}


Something about the additional parameters that are used during optimization
Something about the confidence interval for discrete only
}

\subsection{Formula parameter}{
The \code{formula} argument follows a two part notation:

A two-sided formula describing the model (e.g. \code{y ~ X1 + X2 + P}) to be estimated and a
second right-hand side part in which the endogenous regressors and their distributional
assumptions are indicated (e.g. \code{continuous(P)}). These two parts are separated by a single vertical bar (\code{|}).
In the second part, the special functions \code{continuous} or \code{discrete}, or a combination
of both are used to indicate the endogenous regressors and their respective distribution.
Both functions use the following parameter:

\describe{ \item{...}{The endogenous regressors with the respective distribution.}}

Note that no argument to \code{continuous} or \code{discrete} is to be supplied as character
but as symbols without quotation marks.

See the example section for illustrations on how to specify the \code{formula} parameter.
