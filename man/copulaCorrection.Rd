\usage{
copulaCorrection(formula, endoVar, param, type, method, intercept, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{the model formula, e.g. \code{y ~ X1 + X2 + X3}.}

\item{endoVar}{a string with the name/s of the endogenous variables.}

\item{param}{the vector of initial values for the parameters of the model to be supplied to the optimization algorithm. The parameters to be estimated are \code{theta = \{b,a,rho,sigma\}}, where
\code{b} are the parameters of the exogenous variables, \code{a} is the parameter of the endogenous variable, \code{rho} is the parameter for the correlation between the error and the endogenous regressor, while 
\code{sigma} is the standard deviation of the structural error.}

\item{type}{the type of the endogenous regressor/s. It can take two values, "continuous" or "discrete".}

\item{method}{the method used for estimating the model. It can take two values, "1" or "2", where "1" is the ML approach described in Park and Gupta (2012),
and "2" is the equivalent OLS approach described in the same paper. "1" can be applied when there is just a single, continous endogenous variable. 
With one discrete or more than one continuous endogenous regressors, the second method is applied by default.}

\item{intercept}{optional parameter. The model is estimated by default with 
intercept. If no intercept is desired in the model estimation, intercept should be given the value "FALSE".}

\item{data}{data frame or matrix containing the variables of the model.}
}
\value{
Depending on the method and the type of the variables, it returns the optimal values of the parameters and their standard errors. When the method one is used, the standard 
errors returned are obtained bootstrapping over 10 samples. If more bootstraping samples are desired, the standard errors can be obtained using the \code{\link{boots}} function from the same package.
The following are being returned and can be saved: 
\item{coefficients}{the estimated coefficients.}
\item{standard errors}{the corresponding estimated coefficients standard errors.}
\item{fitted.values}{the fitted values.}
\item{residuals}{the estimated residuals.} 
\item{logLik}{the estimated log likelihood value in the case of method 1.}
\item{AIC}{Akaike Information Criterion in the case of method 1.}
\item{BIC}{Bayesian Information Criterion in the case of method 1.}
}
\description{
Fits linear models with continuous or discrete endogeneous regressors using Gaussian copulas, method presented in Park and Gupta (2012).
This is a statistical technique to address the endogeneity problem, where no external instrumental variables are needed. The important assumption of the model is 
that the endogeneous variables should NOT be normally distributed.
}
\details{
The maximum likelihood estimation is performed by the "BFGS" algorithm. When there are two endogenous regressors, there is no need for initial parameters since the method applied is by default the augmented OLS, which
can be specified by using method two - "method="2"".

\examples{
#load dataset dataCopC1, where P is endogenous, continuous and not normally distributed

data(dataCopC1)
\dontrun{

c1 <- copulaCorrection(formula = y ~ X1 + X2 + P, endoVar ="P", type = "continuous", method = "1",
intercept=TRUE, data=dataCopC1)
summary(c1)
}

# an alternative model can be obtained using "method ="2"".
c12 <- copulaCorrection(formula = y ~ X1 + X2 + P, endoVar = "P", type = "continuous", method = "2",
intercept=TRUE, data = dataCopC1)
summary(c12)

# with 2 endogeneous regressors no initial parameters are needed, the default is the augmented OLS.
data(dataCopC2)
c2 <- copulaCorrection(formula = y ~ X1 + X2 + P1 + P2, endoVar = c("P1","P2"), 
type = "continuous", method="2", intercept=TRUE, data=dataCopC2)
summary(c2)

# load dataset with 1 discrete endogeneous variable. 
# having more than 1 discrete endogenous regressor is also possible
data(dataCopDis)
c3 <- copulaCorrection(formula = y ~ X1 + X2 + P, endoVar = "P", type = "discrete", 
intercept=TRUE, data = dataCopDis)
