## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
* The reworked method `multilevelIV` and accompanying data was added back to the package
* Vignette `REndo-introduction` was added to showcase package usage
* Users can supply a parameter `optimx.args` to tweak the LL optimization to their liking

## NEW FEATURES
* Method `confint` was added for methods `latentIV` and `copulaCorrection`
* Examples and documentation were improved for all methods
