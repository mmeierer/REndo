Description: Fits linear models with endogenous regressors using Internal
    Instrumental Variables (IIV) methods. These are statistical techniques to
    correct for endogeneity when no strong, valid external instrumental variables
    are available. The first version of the package offers two methods, the Latent
    Instrumental Variables (Ebbes et al., 2005) and Lewbel's higher moments approach
    (Lewbel, 1997). In a second version of the package, two other methods will be
    added, joint estimation using copulas (Park and Gupta, 2012) and multilevel GMM
    (Kim and Frees, 2007).
