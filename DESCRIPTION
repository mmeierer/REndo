Description: Fits linear models with endogenous regressor using latent instrumental variable approaches. 
    The methods included in the package are Lewbel's (1997) <doi:10.2307/2171884> higher moments approach as well as 
    Lewbel's (2012) <doi:10.1080/07350015.2012.643126> heteroskedasticity approach, Park and Gupta's (2012) <doi:10.1287/mksc.1120.0718> joint estimation method 
    that uses Gaussian copula and Kim and Frees's (2007) <doi:10.1007/s11336-007-9008-1> multilevel generalized
    method of moment approach that deals with endogeneity in a multilevel setting.
    These are statistical techniques to address the endogeneity problem where no external instrumental variables are needed.
    Note that with version 2.0.0 sweeping changes were introduced which greatly improve 
    functionality and usability but break backwards compatibility.
