# Comment from the authors

This is version 2.4.9 which:
- adds a CITATION file and references to our forthcoming publication in JSS related to this package
- fixes the missing package alias no longer automatically generated by roxygen. This was pointed out to us in an email by Kurt Hornik

We were advised by JSS to add the following comment to our CRAN submission: 

"The DOI in the CITATION is for a new JSS publication that will be registered after publication on CRAN.""
