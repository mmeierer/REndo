# Comment from the authors
This is version 2.4.4 which fixes the documentation to conform to HTML5. This has previously been reported by CRAN as an R CMD check error but not anymore. Still, we consider it good practice to fix this.


## Test environments
* local install on OS X 10.15.7, R 4.2.0, devtools 2.4.3
* github actions: win, osx, linux (release and devel)
* win-builder: release and devel
* rhub: check_for_cran

## R CMD check results 
There were 0 ERRORs, 0 WARNINGs, and 1-3 insignificant NOTEs (mis-spellings, invalid DOI).

## Downstream dependencies
We are not aware of any downstream dependencies.
